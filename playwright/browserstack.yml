projectName: Bitfocus Companion
# Set `buildName` as the name of the job / testsuite being run
buildName: browserstack-playwright
# `buildIdentifier` is a unique id to differentiate every execution that gets appended to
# buildName. Choose your buildIdentifier format from the available expressions:
# ${BUILD_NUMBER} (Default): Generates an incremental counter with every execution
# ${DATE_TIME}: Generates a Timestamp with every execution. Eg. 05-Nov-19:30
# Read more about buildIdentifiers here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/organize-tests
buildIdentifier: '#${BUILD_NUMBER}' # Supports strings along with either/both ${expression}

# =======================================
# Platforms (Browsers / Devices to test)
# =======================================
# Platforms object contains all the browser / device combinations you want to test on.
# Entire list available here -> (https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/automate)
platforms:
  - os: OS X

# =======================
# Parallels per Platform
# =======================
# The number of parallel threads to be used for each platform set.
# BrowserStack's SDK runner will select the best strategy based on the configured value

#
# Example 2 - If you have configured 1 platform and set `parallelsPerPlatform` as 5, a total of 5 (1 * 5) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
parallelsPerPlatform: 1
