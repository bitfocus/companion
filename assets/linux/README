# Quickstart guide

1. Headless Companion

   If you want to run companion on a headless machine, consider using the CompanionPi install script

   This can be run with:
   $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitfocus/companion-pi/main/install.sh | bash

   The benefit of this approach is that it will setup and manage any required dependencies, udev rules for you, and provide you with an easy script to run to perform an update.

   Alternatively, you are able to set it up yourself and define a systemd unit to launch it or do whatever you wish. For examples on how to do this, check the scripts in the CompanionPi repository https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-pi#other-debianubuntu

2. Required Dependencies

   Companion requires some dependencies that aren't included by default on some Debian and Ubuntu installations.

   $ apt-get update
   $ apt-get install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev libfontconfig1

3. Udev rules

   For Companion to be able to access your Streamdecks, Loupedecks, xkeys or other supported USB devices, some udev rules must be setup.

   Since Companion 4.2 surfaces are integrated through modules. This means we can't provide a statically generated udev rules file.

   Instead, Companion will generate one on the fly as modules get installed and uninstalled in the config folder.  
   Our headless tooling will handle loading that for you, but if setting up manually, whenever changing the surface integrations will
   want to copy that file into /etc/udev/rules.d/ and run
   $ udevadm control --reload-rules
   And replugging any usb devices that Companion should be able to use.

   The headless rules expect companion to be run as a member of a group called `companion`. This is necessary to assign usb permissions correctly, unless you modify the rules file.

4. Launching

   To run companion, either run companion-launcher to get the desktop build, or run the ./companion_headless.sh script to start it headless.

   If when launching it gives an error "Using GTK 2/3 and GTK 4 in the same process is not supported", you can resolve this by appending the argument: --gtk-version=3
