Each action can be delayed to run a certain number of milliseconds after the button is triggered. Delays can be configured to be _Absolute_ (default) or _Relative_, by toggling the checkbox in the button styling section.

**Absolute Delays**

All actions run a certain number of milliseconds from the start of the button press. Actions without a delay start immediately. This is the default behavior.

**Relative Delays**

Each action runs a certain number of milliseconds after the previous action _started_.

The order the actions are listed in matters when using relative delays. Actions can be reordered by grabbing the sort icon next to each action and dragging it up or down.
