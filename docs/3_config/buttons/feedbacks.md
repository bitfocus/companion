Feedbacks are a way of dynamically updating a buttons style based on the state of devices or other variables.

Some modules are able to provide feedback back to the button, such as changing the button's foreground or background colors to reflect the current status of the device.

Companion has some builtin feedbacks, to allow for generic functionality such as changing the style when a variable has a certain value.

The feedbacks can also be reordered by grabbing the sort icon next and dragging it up or down, their value gets applied on top of the configured style of the button in the order shown.

The amount of control the feedbacks give you over the style change varies depending on the module. Newer feedbacks typically give you the ability to change any style property you desire, older ones are often limited to foreground and background colors.
If you find this to be a limitation for your use of a module, open a feature request on that modules GitHub to get the feedbacks updated.
