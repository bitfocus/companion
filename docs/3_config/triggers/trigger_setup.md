Once you add a trigger, it can be opened in the edit panel on the right.

When adding a new trigger, it starts off as disabled so that it doesn't get executed until you are ready for it.

To begin with you should give it a name, and fill in the other fields.


Triggers have 3 sections to configure

- **Events**
  This defines when the trigger to be executed.  
  Common events are **Time interval** and **On variable change**

- **Condition**
  This allows you to apply a filter on the events.  
  For example, if using the **On variable change** event, you can use a condition to limit the trigger to execute only when the variable has a value of `1`.  
  This is a subset of the feedbacks that can be used on buttons.

- **Actions**
  This defines what will happen when the trigger executes and condition is met.  
  Every action that can be used on a button can also be used here. If you want, you can make it press a button using the 'internal: Press and release' action.
