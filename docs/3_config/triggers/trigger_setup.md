All triggers have a few identical configuration fields that need to be filled out before they can be created.

- **Name**  
  An identifier for you has no direct purpose other than giving a quick way to identify one trigger from the rest.

- **Button**  
  This defines what button should be pressed when the condition below is met. The button is defined with the same syling as can be seen at the top of each button, with the page number first and the button number on that page after. A quick example could be with button 6 on page 1 becomes 1.6 , button 19 on page 3 becomes 3.19, and so on.

- **Type**  
  This specifies what type of condition should be met before the trigger presses the button selected above. Each trigger type will change what specific information will be needed for it to trigger the button press.
