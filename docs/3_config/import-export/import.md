On the **Full import** tab, you can specify what you want to import and then import it while performing a full reset of the configuration.

Make sure to take an export of your current configuration first, in case you make a mistake.

The **Buttons** and **Triggers** tabs allow you to import a subset of the pages or triggers, and optionally remap the connections.
