This tab allows you to configure your Streamdecks and other **Surfaces**

If any of your Stream Decks are not showing up, press the **Rescan USB** button. Use with care as rescanning will block all operations while the scan is ongoing. You can avoid needing to do this by enabling **Watch for new USB Devices** in the settings page.

Here you can see all your current surfaces, both local and connected over satellite. As well as any available emulators

Clicking the **Settings** button next to a device lets you change some things about how the Stream Deck operates:

**Note** The exact list of settings varies depending on the type of the surface

- **Surface Group**: Whether to put this surface into a [Surface Group](#3_config/surfaces/groups.md)
- **Use Last Page At Startup**: Whether the surface should remember the last page it was on at startup, or if it should use the startup page slider bwloe
- **Startup Page**: If 'Use Last Page At Startup' is not enabled, the page the StreamDeck will show at startup
- **X Offset in grid**: If the device is smaller than the 8x4 grid, you can adjust the position of the surface within the grid
- **Y Offset in grid**: If the device is smaller than the 8x4 grid, you can adjust the position of the surface within the grid
- **Brightness**: The brightness of the buttons.
- **Button rotation**: If you've physically rotated your Stream Deck, you can use this setting to make the buttons match that orientation.
- **Never pin code lock**: If you want to ignore this device from the pincode locking.

In the settings for each **Emulator**, you can configure some extra behaviours.
