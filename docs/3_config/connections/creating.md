If you have not already installed a version of the module you need, you may need to toggle the list to show those which are available, not just those which are installed.

1.  Add a new device, by scrolling through the list or through a search.
2.  Choose the specific device you want to add.
2.  Fill out the dialog to choose the version of the module to use. In this, you can always choose any installed versions, and if you are able to access the store it will offer to install the latest version.

3.  Enter the connection information for device. Save the changes.

Your new device should now show in the Connections tab along with all the other devices you want to control.
Each device needs to be a separate connection. If you have two separate Barco E2, you need to add both of them as separate connections.

Note: if you have multiple connections using the same module, they can now each be running different versions of the module.

Once you have added your connections, you can reorder or filter them in the table. In the rightmost column, you can expand a list of buttons:

![Connections Popover](images/connection-popover.png?raw=true 'Connections Popover')

- **Help** will open that module's help information. This is also possible in the list on the right before adding a connection.
- **Known Issues** will take you to the GitHub page for the module. You should report any bugs you encounter with the module here, or any feature requests for missing functionality. Tip: The more detail you give on a bug or feature request, the more likely it is to be handled quickly.
- **Variables** will show a list of all the variables that a connection provides. These can be used in various places either explained later on.
- **View Logs** is a debug log for the module. When reporting a bug, module developers may want extra information from here to help figure out the bug. To most users this will not be interesting.

A full list of supported devices can also be found on the website. [Companion Module Support List](https://bitfocus.io/connections)
