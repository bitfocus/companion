In the Buttons tab, you can configure the buttons for your Stream Deck.

![Buttons Page](images/buttons.png?raw=true 'Buttons Page')

The Buttons layout has 99 pages that can be navigated using the grey left/right arrows, or the dropdown box. You can give your pages a unique name by replacing the word _PAGE_ right next to the page number.

If you hold down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, you can trigger a button directly by clicking on it.


Several actions exist for rearranging your buttons, **Copy**, **Move**, or **Delete**.  
First click on the desired action, then click on the button you want to apply that action to. Finally (in the case of the `Copy` and `Move` actions) click on the destination button.  
Alternatively, use the standard keyboard shortcuts to perform these operations.


There are also two buttons for resetting the page:

- **Wipe page**: Erases all buttons on the page and adds the navigation buttons.
- **Reset page buttons**: Leaves the buttons intact, but adds the default navigation buttons.

**Export page** exports just this page's buttons to a download which can later be imported to another page or a different Companion config. See the [Import / Export](#header-import--export) section below.
