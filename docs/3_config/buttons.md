The Buttons layout has numerous pages that can be navigated using the grey left/right arrows, or the dropdown box. Each of these pages is also listed in the **Pages** tab in the right panel, which is where you can manage the pages you have. In this panel you can give your pages names

If you hold down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, you can trigger a button directly by clicking on it.

Also above the buttons, you can:

- **View Scale** Adjust the view scale of the grid
- **Home position** When scrolling around a large grid, this will snap the view back to viewing 0/0 in the top left corner
- **Edit page** adjust various settings for the current page
- **Export page** exports just this page's buttons to a download which can later be imported to another page or a different Companion config. See the [Import / Export](#header-import--export) section below.

Several actions exist below for rearranging your buttons, **Copy**, **Move**,
**Swap**, or **Delete**. First click on the desired action, then click on the
button you want to apply that action to. Finally (in the case of the `Copy`,
`Swap` and `Move` actions) click on the destination button. Alternatively, use
the standard keyboard shortcuts to perform these operations.

There are also two buttons for resetting the page:

- **Wipe page**: Erases all buttons on the page and adds the navigation buttons.
- **Reset page buttons**: Leaves the buttons intact, but adds the default navigation buttons.
