The Log section gives status updates of commands going out and coming back to Companion. Different log levels can be filtered.

Use the three buttons to toggle warnings, info and debug on and off. Errors will always be displayed in the log, no matter the settings. Last, of all, you have the option to clear the current log history.

Be sure to check here if you're running into problems with a module.
