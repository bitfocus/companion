This tab lets you import or export your configuration to a `.companionconfig` file, which can be used to backup your configuration or move it to a new computer. You can also choose to import just a single page from your file.

If you only want to export a single page, this can be done from the primary [buttons](#header-2-buttons) page via the `Export Page` button.

You're also able to completely reset your configuration here as well.
