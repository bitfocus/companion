From the Connections tab, you can add, edit and remove devices. You can also see if a device is connected by looking at the Status column.

Press the question mark **"?"** icon to open that module's help information.

**To add a new device**

1.  Add a new device, by scrolling though the list or through a search.
2.  Choose the specific device you want to add.
3.  Enter the connection information for device. Apply the changes.

Your new device should now show in the Connections tab along with all the other devices you want to control.
Each device needs to be a separate connection. If you have two separate Barco E2, you need to add both of them as separate connections.

After an connection has been created and successfully configured, it may provide you with a list of [Module Variables](#header-dynamic-variables) you can use when configuring your button. This will be described below. **Please note** these have moved places since Companion 2.1.2, and they are now located in their own tab under **Buttons**, or can be viewed by clicking the **$** icon.

If something is missing, please make a support request on the GitHub page for the module describing the feature, use cases, and providing documentation, if needed, for the implementation. You can click the bug icon to take you directly to the GitHub page for each module.

A full list of supported devices can also be found on our website. [Companion Module Support List](https://bitfocus.io/support)
