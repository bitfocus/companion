Surface groups is a recent addition which allows for linking multiple surfaces to always be on the same page.  
This is convenient for setups such as having two Stream Deck XLs side by side, which want to be treated as a single 16x4 device.

To do this, use the **+ Add Group** button to create a new surface group. Then for each surface you want to add to the group, open its settings and change the surface group dropdown to the newly created group.

Elsewhere in Companion, the actions which can change the page of a surface will no longer see the individual surfaces, and can instead pick the group.

Another use case for this, is that you can use a group as a stable id for a surface.  
This helps setups where you need to be able to swap out a streamdeck quickly, and also need actions to reference specific streamdecks.  
You can create your groups and program the system ahead of time, then later add or remove surfaces to the groups without needing to update any buttons.
