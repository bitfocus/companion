## Page Permissions: Restricting access to pages by device or group

Starting with v4.2, individual surfaces or surface-groups provide the option to restrict which pages a device -- or devices in a group -- may access. For example:

---

## ![Restrict Pages Setting](images/restrict_pages.png?raw=true 'Discovery')

This allows you to distribute a single site configuration but with access to particular pages defined by a person's role. Each device or group can then be limited to just one or a few pages relevant to their role.

_Tip_: Next/Previous page-change actions -- including the standard page buttons, custom actions, and swiping (for surfaces that support it) -- will follow the order selected here. If you want to change the order, simply delete items from the list and re-select them in the order you prefer.
