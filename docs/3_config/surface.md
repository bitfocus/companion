This tab will show the connected Elgato Stream Decks.

If any of your Stream Decks are not showing up, press the **Rescan USB** button. Use with care as rescanning will block all operations while the scan is ongoing.

**Important: If your devices are showing but they don't show the ID, you need to update your Stream Deck using the Elgato app**. See [Update instructions](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/blob/master/documentation/Updating%20streamdeck.md).

Clicking the **Settings** button next to a device lets you change some things about how the Stream Deck operates:

- **Brightness**: The brightness of the buttons.
- **Button rotation**: If you've physically rotated your Stream Deck, you can use this setting to make the buttons match that orientation.
- **Page**: Sets the startup page on a surface but also changes the current page to match.
