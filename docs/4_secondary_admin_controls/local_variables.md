In some cases, such as within a button, you can also use Local Variables. This is signified by the globe icon next to the input. Local variables have information relative to the current state of the item, for example details of the page, column and row a button is on that's been pressed.

The current list of supported local variables is below, but by typing `$(this:` in the text field, you'll see all the variable suggestions.

- Page number of the button   
  Variable: `this:page`   
- Column number of the button   
  Variable: `this:column`   
- Row number of the button   
  Variable: `this:row`   
- The current step of this button   
  Variable: `this:step`   
- Page name of the current page   
  Variable: `this:page_name`   
- The id of the surface triggering this action   
  Variable: `this:surface_id`
