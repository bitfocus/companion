Some modules come with pre-made buttons to speed up creating your pages.

Presets works in a folder like structure where you first select the module, then a category, and last, you get a list of pre-made presets ready to be "drag and dropped" onto your pages.

If one of your modules supports presets, it will be listed in this tab for you to select, just like below.

_An example of categories of presets you might meet in a single module_

![Preset Buttons](images/preset-buttons.png?raw=true 'Preset Buttons')  
_Here is an example of presets made for mix 1 in vMix_

Drag the preset buttons onto a page's button when in the Button Layout view.  
Keep in mind you may still need to configure the preset after adding it to a button.

_**Note:** you can't add new presets as a user, they are all pre-made in code._
