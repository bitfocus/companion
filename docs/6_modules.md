All the instances in Companion are modules, and a module is what's used to control an external device or piece of software. Modules can't be upgraded by the user after a release. Any update to a module will need a new build of Companion. Please look at the Beta builds to test newer versions of specific modules.

Modules are being added and updated all the time. A complete list of supported devices/modules can be found on the [Support List](https://bitfocus.io/support) page.

If your device or software is missing from this list, please [let us know](https://bitfocus.io/about#intouch), and we'll try to create support for it. If you're in a hurry and need express delivery, we'll get back to you with a price and delivery date. You can also [ask the open source community](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) by submitting a feature request.
