All the connections in Companion are modules, and a module is what's used to control an external device or piece of software. Modules used to be built-in to Companion, but starting with 4.0 they are downloadable plugins.

Modules are being added and updated all the time. A complete list of supported devices/modules can be found on the [Support List](https://bitfocus.io/connections) page.

Most of the modules are written and maintained by the community. If your device or software is missing from this list, there are a few things you can do:
1. If you have any experience writing code, you could make the module yourself, we are happy to accept all contributions. Read more [here](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-base/wiki/Module-development-101)
2. Some members on the [Community forum](https://bfoc.us/qjk0reeqmy) are available to hire to implement modules.
3. While the Bitfocus team is small, they are available to implement some modules, [get in touch](https://bitfocus.io/about#intouch) for a price and delivery date.
4. You can also [ask the open source community](https://bfoc.us/5xcykgx03n) by submitting a request, and hope that someone is willing to do the work for you.
