**Emulator** is a tool to test and use the setup, even if you donâ€™t have a Stream Deck connected. It will open in a new browser tab and will function just like a Stream Deck would.

You can use keyboard hotkeys to control the emulator and trigger button presses. Instructions are found on the bottom of the emulator page.
