**Web buttons** is a way of viewing all your buttons across all pages on a single screen, which may be useful if you want to use a web browser on a tablet to control Companion.

If you would like to just view one page or a select few, you can add text to the end of the URL in your browser. Just add **?pages=** and the page numbers you want to see separated by a comma. This works in all three **Web Buttons** layouts.

**Examples**

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/tablet.html?pages=2  
  _Includes only page 2_
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/tablet.html?pages=3,7,12  
  _Includes only pages 3, 7, and 12_
