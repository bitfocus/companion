**Web buttons** is a way of viewing all your buttons across all pages on a single screen, which may be useful if you want to use a web browser on a tablet to control Companion. It is an alternative approach to the **Emulator**, allowing for better viewing on larger screens.

However, the **Web buttons** are unable to follow any page changes you have setup on the buttons, as it does not appear to Companion as a **Surface**.

There are many configuration options available on this page, click the cog in the top right to open the panel. Once you have configured it, bookmark the URL, as your selection is stored as URL parameters.

In previous versions of Companion there were a few different Web and tablet button views. Most of these needed rewriting due to internal changes in Companion, so have consolidated into one more powerful view.
