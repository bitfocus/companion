**Emulator** is a tool that gives a streamdeck like interface in your browser. It interacts with Companion just like a streamdeck does, and can be used either to test a setup or as a low cost way of giving someone some buttons they can press.

By default a single emulator is created, since 3.0 it is possible to have multiple setup. An emulator can be viewed from multiple places at once, but they will all share the same page in Companion. By using multiple emulators, you can allow different people to view different pages simultaneously.

You can use keyboard hotkeys to control the emulator and trigger button presses. Instructions are found on the bottom of the emulator selection page.

There are some additional setting available in the Surfaces tab for each Emulator, these are covered in more detail later.
