Companion has a number of features that help you limit casual access to the admin interface and control surfaces. Although none of these features makes an installation secure, they can help to stop casual browsers.

No single page of the Admin interface is dedicated to security, so this help section attempts to gather the features in a single place.

1. [Admin Password](#3_config/settings/admin_password.md), _Settings > Advanced (Admin UI Password)_: If enabled, Companion will require a password to view any of the configuration pages
2. [Surface Lockscreen](#3_config/settings/pin_lockout.md), _Settings > Surfaces (PIN Lockout)_: Allows all connected surfaces to be locked out after a timeout and requires a PIN to unlock.
3. [Page Permissions](#3_config/surfaces/pagepermissions.md) _Surfaces_ tab: If enabled for a device or a group, it allows you to limit page access for that device/group.
4. [Remote Access](#5_remote_control.md) _Settings > Protocols_: Determine whether remote computers/devices can initiate a connection to Companion.
