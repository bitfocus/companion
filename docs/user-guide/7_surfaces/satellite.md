description: Connect remote surfaces via Companion Satellite.

In some environments, it can be useful to connect remote Stream Decks (or other supported surfaces) to a central Companion instance.

[Companion Satellite](https://l.companion.free/q/YH8dZkH1Q) provides this functionality by allowing remote devices to appear as surfaces in a central Companion server.

:::note
The satellite application currently supports a smaller set of surfaces than a local Companion instance. We are actively working to expand compatibility.
