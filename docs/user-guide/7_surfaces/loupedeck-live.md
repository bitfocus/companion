It is possible to use the Loupedeck Live, Loupedeck Live S, Loupedeck CT and Razer Stream Controller with Companion.

Your Loupedeck must be running firmware v0.2.0 or later, and the Loupedeck software must not be running.
Enable support for it in Companion's settings and rescan for USB devices.

The layout closely matches the device. Touching and swiping on the tall touch strips is mapped to user-defined custom variables. Values vary from 0 to 256. See the [Contour Shuttle](contour-shuttle.md#setting-variables) section for examples and more detailed instructions.
