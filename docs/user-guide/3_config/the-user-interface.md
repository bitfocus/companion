This page describes the main Companion admin interface and the common places you'll interact with when configuring devices and buttons.

- Main navigation happens in the left Sidebar.
- Pages are typically split into a large main panel (left) for primary tasks and a secondary panel (right) for details, previews, or contextual settings.
- On smaller screens, the main and secondary panels will be combined using additional navigation controls to reduce scrolling and keep contextual settings accessible.
