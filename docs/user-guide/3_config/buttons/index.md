In the Buttons tab, you can configure the buttons for your Stream Deck. The number of buttons in the grid can be changed in the settings, it can be grown in all 4 directions.

The Buttons layout has multiple pages that can be navigated using the grey left/right arrows or the dropdown. Each page is also listed in the **Pages** tab in the right panel where you can manage pages and give them names.

Hold down the SHIFT key and click a button to trigger it directly.

Above the buttons you'll find:

- **View Scale** — adjust the grid view scale.
- **Home position** — when scrolling a large grid, snap the view back to 0/0 (top-left).
- **Edit page** — adjust settings for the current page.
- **Export page** — download this page's buttons for import into another page or Companion config. See [Import / Export].

Several actions exist below for rearranging your buttons, **Copy**, **Move**,
**Swap**, or **Delete**. First click on the desired action, then click on the
button you want to apply that action to. Finally (in the case of the `Copy`,
`Swap` and `Move` actions) click on the destination button. Alternatively, use
the standard keyboard shortcuts to perform these operations.

There are also two buttons for resetting the page:

- **Wipe page** — erases all buttons on the page and adds the navigation buttons.
- **Reset page buttons** — leaves the buttons intact, but adds the default navigation buttons.
