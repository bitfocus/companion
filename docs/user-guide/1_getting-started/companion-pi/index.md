# Companion Pi

This lets you run Companion on a Raspberry Pi by providing a prebuilt image, or tooling which allows you to install Companion to the SBC (single board computer) or other Linux machine of your choosing.

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to get Companion running on a Pi:

1. **[Using the CompanionPi Image](./using-the-image)** - The easiest option. Download a prebuilt image and flash it to your SD card.
2. **[Manual Installation](./manual-install)** - For advanced users who want to install Companion on an existing Linux system.

Before you begin, make sure to check the [Choosing a Pi](./choosing-a-pi) guides.
