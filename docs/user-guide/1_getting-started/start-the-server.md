When you open Companion, the launcher window will appear. From the opening screen, choose your network interface and change the port if needed — the default is 8000. This is the port of the Companion server.

If you need to remotely control Companion from other computers on the same network, change the 'GUI Interface' to make Companion accessible on a different network interface, and use the URL shown underneath the text “Running”. To configure Companion from the computer you're running it on, click the **Launch GUI** button — it will open the Admin page in your default browser.

We recommend using Google Chrome, but other up-to-date browsers should work. There are known issues with the built-in browsers on older Android and iOS devices.

## Advanced Settings

You can click the cog in the top right corner to open some advanced settings. If you are a module developer, you will want to enable the developer tools there. You can read more about the module development flow in the [module development docs](https://companion.free/for-developers/module-development/home).
