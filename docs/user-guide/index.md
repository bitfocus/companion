# Welcome to Companion

Companion is free and open-source software.

Companion can control over 700 different types of devices — mixers, switchers, lighting, streaming gear, and more. See the full list of supported modules and drivers on the [Bitfocus website](https://bfoc.us/m6idfk19cm)

If you find an issue, please let us know on [Slack](https://bfoc.us/ke7e9dqgaz), file a [bug report](https://bfoc.us/ead30tx91c), or — even better — send a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion).

Bitfocus initially launched the project; it is now 100% community driven.

If Companion helps your business, consider [donating](https://bfoc.us/ccfbf8wm2x).

Let's get started!
