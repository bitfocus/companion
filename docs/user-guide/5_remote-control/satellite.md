description: Companion Satellite protocol for remote surfaces.

In some environments, it can be useful to connect a remote Streamdeck into Companion.

We have developed [Companion Satellite](https://l.companion.free/q/YH8dZkH1Q) for this purpose.

The satellite protocol is documented in [the developers' documentation](https://companion.free/for-developers/Satellite-API).
