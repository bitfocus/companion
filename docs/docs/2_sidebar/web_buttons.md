title: Web buttons

The **Web buttons** view shows all your buttons across all pages on a single screen. This is useful if you want to use a web browser on a tablet to control Companion.

Note: the Web buttons view does not appear to Companion as a **Surface**, so it cannot follow page changes you set up on buttons.

There are many configuration options available on this page â€” click the cog in the top right to open the panel. Once you have configured it, bookmark the URL; your selection is stored as URL parameters.

In previous versions of Companion there were a few different web and tablet button views. These were rewritten due to internal changes in Companion and consolidated into this single, more powerful view.
