The **Emulator** provides a Stream Deckâ€“like interface in your browser. It interacts with Companion just like a physical Stream Deck and can be used to test setups or give someone a low-cost set of buttons.

By default a single emulator is created. Since Companion 3.0 it's possible to have multiple emulators. An emulator can be viewed from multiple locations at once, but they all share the same Companion page. Using multiple emulators allows different people to view different pages simultaneously.

You can use keyboard hotkeys to control the emulator and trigger button presses. Instructions are at the top of the emulator selection page.

Additional settings for each emulator are available in the Surfaces tab and are covered later.
