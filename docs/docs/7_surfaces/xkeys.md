Many [XKeys](https://xkeys.com/xkeys.html) products can be used with Companion.

Since Companion v3.2, XKeys devices default to their physical (native) layout, which is often larger than Companion's default grid. Prior to 4.0 it was possible to opt into the old layout; this has now been removed.

There is limited support for T-bars and shuttle/jog wheels; their values are exposed via a few hardcoded internal variables.
