It is possible to use the Blackmagic ATEM Micro Panel with Companion (since v3.4.0), and the Resolve Replay Editor (since v4.0.0).

Enable support for it in Companion's settings and rescan for USB devices. This works over both USB and Bluetooth. Do not run the ATEM software at the same time â€” both programs will listen to presses and update colours.

The layout matches the device's natural grid when blank spaces are compacted. The T-bar occupies a column in this layout.

To use the T-bar, go to the surface settings and select a custom variable to receive the value. You can also provide an expression to control how the T-bar LEDs are lit.
