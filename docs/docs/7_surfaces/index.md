Companion supports a variety of physical and virtual input devices (surfaces) in addition to remote-control protocols. Surfaces provide buttons, encoders, displays, and other controls that you can map to actions in Companion.

Each surface may have unique capabilities and limitations. See the individual surface pages for model-specific details, configuration tips, and known limitations.
