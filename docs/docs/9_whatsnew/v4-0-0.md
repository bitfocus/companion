## Modules as plugins

Previously, all modules were bundled with Companion and could only be updated when Companion itself was updated. Now modules are distributed as separate plugins that can be installed and updated independently.

You can install modules in two ways:

- **From the built-in store**: Browse and install modules directly within Companion's interface
- **Offline installation**: Import module bundle files for environments without internet access

This change means you'll get module updates faster and can choose which modules to install based on your specific needs.

_The new module management interface allows you to browse, install, and update modules independently from Companion_

## XKeys button layout simplification

Since Companion 3.2, it has been possible to change the size of pages and to use a more intuitive mapping between physical button layout and Companion's button grid for xkeys surfaces. This new layout was the default for new installations of Companion.  
Prior to this, the mapping of xkeys buttons had to be compressed to translate to the 32 button pages.

Starting with Companion 4.0, support for the old layouts is removed. If you are still using these layouts you will need to update your buttons to match the new layout.
