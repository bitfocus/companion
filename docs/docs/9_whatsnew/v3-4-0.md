## Button Grid View Scale

A new menu has been added above the button grid, giving you the option to adjust the grid‚Äôs view scale.

Building on the grid size adjustment feature introduced in v3.2, this allows you to manually control the view scale, so you can fit more or less of the grid on your screen at once.

## Logic in Feedbacks

As one of the oldest open feature requests, this fulfills a long asked for feature of performing logic operations within feedbacks.

The core of this functionality is a set of new internal feedbacks: `internal: Logic AND`, `internal: Logic OR` and `internal: Logic XOR`.
These work just like other feedbacks, but instead of option fields, you can add other feedbacks to compose logical conditions.

We can't wait to see the complex creations you come up with using these and the growing power of Companion!

## Expanding expressions

Expressions have been a key component of complex creations since their introduction a few years ago, and their functionality continues to evolve with each release.

In this update, input fields that support expressions are now multiline, allowing for better organization. Comments and temporary variables are also supported, making it easier to write and understand more complex expressions.

For example the following expression is now valid:

```
// Precompute value
a = 1 + 2
a + (a * a)
```

The result of the last statement (typically the last line) will be used as the output of the expression. You can also combine multiple statements on a single line by separating them with a semicolon (;).

Additionally, it‚Äôs now possible to mutate objects and arrays within expressions.
