The Buttons layout has multiple pages that can be navigated using the grey left/right arrows or the dropdown. Each page is also listed in the **Pages** tab in the right panel where you can manage pages and give them names.

Hold down the SHIFT key and click a button to trigger it directly.

Above the buttons you'll find:

- **View Scale** — adjust the grid view scale.
- **Home position** — when scrolling a large grid, snap the view back to 0/0 (top-left).
- **Edit page** — adjust settings for the current page.
- **Export page** — download this page's buttons for import into another page or Companion config. See [Import / Export].

Several actions exist below for rearranging your buttons, **Copy**, **Move**,
**Swap**, or **Delete**. First click on the desired action, then click on the
button you want to apply that action to. Finally (in the case of the `Copy`,
`Swap` and `Move` actions) click on the destination button. Alternatively, use
the standard keyboard shortcuts to perform these operations.

There are also two buttons for resetting the page:

- **Wipe page** — erases all buttons on the page and adds the navigation buttons.
- **Reset page buttons** — leaves the buttons intact, but adds the default navigation buttons.
