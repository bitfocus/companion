This tab lets you import or export your configuration to a `.companionconfig` file, which can be used to backup your configuration or move it to a new computer. You can also choose to import just a single page from your file.

If you only want to export a single page, this can be done from the primary [buttons](#header-2-buttons) page via the `Export Page` button.

You're also able to completely reset your configuration here as well.

## Import

Here you can import a `.companionconfig` file. Various options will be disabled if it is not possible to import them from the file you have provided.

On the **Full import** tab, you can specify which categories you want to import. Clicking the button: "Import, Preserving unselected components" allows you to import without performing a full reset (your selected components will still be reset and then repopulated from the import file). The "Full Reset then Import" button will reset all components and then import only the selected configuration categories.

Make sure to take an export of your current configuration first, in case you make a mistake.

The **Buttons** and **Triggers** tabs allow you to import a subset of the pages or triggers, and optionally remap the connections.
