This tab allows you to configure your Stream Decks and other **Surfaces**.

If any of your Stream Decks are not showing up, press the **Rescan USB** button. You can avoid needing to do this by enabling **Watch for new USB Devices** on the settings page.

Here you can see all your current surfaces, both local and connected over Satellite, as well as any available emulators.

Click the **Settings** button next to a device to change how that surface behaves.

Note: the exact list of settings varies by surface type.

- **Surface Group**: Assign this surface to a [Surface Group](#3_config/surfaces/groups.md).
- **Use Last Page At Startup**: Whether the surface should remember the last page it was on at startup, or use the Startup Page setting instead.
- **Startup Page**: If 'Use Last Page At Startup' is not enabled, the page the Surface will show at startup.
- **X Offset in grid**: If the device is smaller than the 8x4 grid, you can adjust the position of the surface within the grid
- **Y Offset in grid**: If the device is smaller than the 8x4 grid, you can adjust the position of the surface within the grid
- **Brightness**: The brightness of the buttons.
- **Button rotation**: If you've physically rotated your Surface, use this to match the button orientation.
- **Never pin code lock**: Exclude this device from pin-code locking.

In the settings for each **Emulator**, you can configure additional behaviours.
