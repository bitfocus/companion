In 4.0, the modules have been moved to be downloadable plugins. This allows you to get updates to modules much quicker and easier than before. As part of this, we do not distribute modules anymore with Companion.

Note: When updating Companion, your modules are no longer automatically updated for you. You will need to visit them here to update them when you are ready to.  
Similarly, when importing a config, you should visit here to make sure appropriate versions of the module are selected and are installed.

If you are on an offline system, the list of the right will likely be empty and you will need to download and import the offline module bundle from the website. You can read more about this in the [Modules section](#6_modules.md)
