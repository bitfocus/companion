When you open Companion, a server window will open. From the opening screen, choose your network interface and change the port if needed - the default is 8000. This is the port of the Companion server.

Companion should be running on the same computer that the Stream Deck is connected to. It can run on the same machine as, for example, Barco Event Master or other software for control/playback; it uses minimal resources.

If you need to remotely control Companion from other computers on the same network, use the URL under the text “Running”. Normally, to configure Companion from the computer you're running it on, click the **Launch GUI** button, it will open the Admin page in your default browser.

We recommend using Google Chrome.
