When you open Companion, a server window will open. From the opening screen, choose your network interface and change the port if needed - the default is 8000. This is the port of the Companion server.

In most cases you will run Companion on the same computer that the Stream Deck or other supported surface is connected to. This is not necessary if you are not using a physical control surface, or want to connect them over the network with **Companion Satellite**

You can run other software on the same machine as Companion. Smaller setups are often made up of running VMix and Companion on a machine, while larger setups will connect to more devices or software over a network.

If you need to remotely control Companion from other computers on the same network, change the 'GUI Interface' to make Companion accessible on a different network interface, and use the URL shown underneath the text “Running”. To configure Companion from the computer you're running it on, you can click the **Launch GUI** button, it will open the Admin page in your default browser.

If you are a module-developer, the cog in the top right will enable some developer tools. You can read more about this in the [module development wiki](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-base/wiki)

We recommend using Google Chrome, but other up to date browsers should work. There are known issues with the built-in browsers on older Android and iOS devices.
