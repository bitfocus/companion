In the left panel of the modules page you will find a list of the modules that you have installed into your Companion system.  
The table has some filters and is also searchable, so that you can control what is shown. Selecting a module in this table will open more details in the right panel.

The 'import module package' button lets you import a module package. This should be a `.tgz` file produced by building a single module, most likely distributed by the module author. With this, you can now easily import a test build of a module, or a module which is internal to your company or organisation.

The 'import offline module bundle' button can be used for the bulk importing of modules. On the [Bitfocus website](https://bitfocus.io/download), you can download an offline module bundle. This is intended for installations which are offline and cannot directly access the store. These bundles are versioned the same as Companion, so you can be sure that the modules contained will work with a specific version of Companion
