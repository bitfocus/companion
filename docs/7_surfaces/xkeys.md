Many of the [XKeys](https://xkeys.com/xkeys.html) products can be used with Companion.

Due to Companion being limited to 32 buttons per page (we are looking into improving this [Github issue](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/issues/1607)), many of the xkeys devices do not translate across nicely.

Instead, Companion will map the buttons through in order (working across in rows) to buttons in Companion, using as many pages as needed.

There is some limited support for T-bars and shuttle/jog wheels, only supported by a couple of modules.
