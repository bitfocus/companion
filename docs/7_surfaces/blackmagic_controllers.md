It is possible to use the Blackmagic ATEM Micro Panel with Companion since v3.4.0, and the Resolve Replay Editor since v4.0.0

Enable support for it in the Companion settings, and rescan for USB devices.  
This works over both usb and bluetooth. You must make sure to not be running the ATEM software at the same time, or both bits of software will be listening to presses and updating the colours.

The layout matches the natural grid of the device, if you were to squash everything together to remove the blank spaces.
However, the tbar occupies a column in this.

To use the tbar, go to the surface settings and you can select a custom-variable to pipe the value to. You can also provide an expression to control how the tbar leds are lit.
