It is possible to use the [Loupedeck Live, Loupedeck Live S, Loupedeck CT](https://loupedeck.com/products/) and [Razer Stream Controller](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/streaming-accessories/razer-stream-controller) with Companion.

It requires your Loupedeck to be running v0.2.0 or later firmware, and the Loupedeck software must not be running.  
Enable support for it in the Companion settings, and rescan for usb devices.

The layout pretty closely matches what you should expect based on the device, but the tall touch strips are not mapped across yet.
